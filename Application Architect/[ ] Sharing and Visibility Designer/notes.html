        <h3>Key Terms, Phrases, and Ideas</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Data access begins with a user.</li>
            <li>Record ownership and full access are synonymous and interchangeable and provide the user with the highest level of access to a record.</li>
            <li>Every record must be owned by a single user or a queue.</li>
            <li>Users higher in a hierarchy (role or territory) inherit the same data access as their subordinates for standard objects.</li>
            <li>Organization-wide defaults are the <b>only</b> way to restrict user access to a record.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Best Practices</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If a single user owns more than 10,000 records
                <ul>
                    <li>The user record of the owner should not hold a role in the role hierarchy.</li>
                    <li>If the owner's user record must hold a role, the role should be at the top of the hierarchy in its own branch of the role hierarchy.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Keep the number of non-portal roles to 25,000 and the number of portal roles to 100,000</li>
            <li>Keep the role hierarchy to no more than 10 levels of branches in the hierarchy.</li>
        </ol>

            <li>A Guide to Sharing Architecture
                <ul>
                    <li>On page 3 under the Role Hierarchy section, paragraph 6 mentions Overlays. What is an overlay?</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>Data Access Mechanisms</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>License Types
                <ul>
                    <li>Full Sharing Model Usage Users/Licenses
                        <ul>
                            <li>Allows access to all sharing components regardless of edition</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>High Volume Portal Users
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do not have access to standard sharing model.</li>
                            <li>Has a completely different sharing model based on foreign key match between portal user and the data on the associated account and contact lookups.</li>
                            <li>HVPU license is only used for the Customer Portal and not the Partner Portal.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Chatter Free Users
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do not have access to standard sharing model.</li>
                            <li>Chatter Free is a collaboration-only license with the following features: Chatter, Profile, People, Groups, Files, Chatter Desktop, and limited Salesforce1 app access.</li>
                            <li>Does NOT have access to any salesforce records, thus, no need for sharing model.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Components</h3>
        <img src="images/sharing overview.png" />
        <ol>
            <li>Profiles and Permission Sets
                <ul>
                    <li>Object level security</li>
                    <li>CRUD</li>
                    <li>FLS</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Record Ownership and Queues
                <ul>
                    <li>Every record must be owned by a single user or a queue.</li>
                    <li>The owner has access to the record, based on the Object Settings for the owner’s profile.</li>
                    <li>Queues help you prioritize, distribute, and assign records to teams who share workloads.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Organization-Wide Defaults
                <ul>
                    <li>Organization-wide sharing settings specify the default level of access users have to each others’ records.</li>
                    <li>You use organization-wide sharing settings to lock down your data to the most restrictive level, and then use the other record-level security and sharing tools to selectively give access to other users.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Role Hierarchy
                <ul>
                    <li>The role hierarchy ensures that managers always have access to the same data as their employees, regardless of the organization-wide default settings.</li>
                    <li>Role hierarchies don't have to match your organization chart exactly. Instead, each role in the hierarchy should represent a level of data access that a user or group of users needs.</li>

                <h3>Key Terms, Phrases, and Ideas</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Data access begins with a user.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Record ownership and full access are synonymous and interchangeable and provide the user with the highest level of access to a record.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Every record must be owned by a single user or a queue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users higher in a hierarchy (role or territory) inherit the same data access as their subordinates for standard objects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Organization-wide defaults are the <b>only</b> way to restrict user access to a record.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Contact ownership-based <b>sharing rules don't apply</b> to private contacts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Only manual share records can be created on standard objects. (Cannot use Apex sharing reasons, but Manual shares can be created with Apex)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The team object is not a first-class object. You can't create custom fields, validations rules, or triggers for teams.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Best Practices</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        If a single user owns more than 10,000 records
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The user record of the owner should not hold a role in the role hierarchy.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the owner's user record must hold a role, the role should be at the top of the hierarchy in its own branch of the role hierarchy.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Keep the number of non-portal roles to 25,000 and the number of portal roles to 100,000
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Keep the role hierarchy to no more than 10 levels of branches in the hierarchy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Keep the total number of public groups for an organization to 100,000.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Don't nest groups more than five levels.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Keep the number of ownership-based sharing rules per object to 1,000.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Keep the number of criteria-sharing rules per object to 50; however, this can be increased by Salesforce.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                                You use organization-wide sharing settings to lock down your data to the most restrictive level, and then use the other record-level security and sharing tools to selectively give access to other users.

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The role hierarchy ensures that managers always have access to the same data as their employees, regardless of the organization-wide default settings.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Role hierarchies don't have to match your organization chart exactly. Instead, each role in the hierarchy should represent a level of data access that a user or group of users needs.

                                Use Cases for Role hierarchy:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <u>Management access</u> – the ability for managers to be able to see and do whatever their subordinates can see and do.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <u>Management reporting</u> – the ability for reporting to roll up in a hierarchical fashion so that anyone higher in the hierarchy sees more data than those below them.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <u>Segregation between organizational branches</u> – different business units don’t need to see each other’s data; having a hierarchy in which you can define separate branches allows you to segregate visibility within business units, while still rolling visibility up to the executive levels above those units.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <u>Segregation within a role</u> – in many organizations/applications, people who all play the same role should not necessarily see each other’s data. Having hierarchical roles allows you to define a “leaf” node in which all data is essentially private, and still roll that data up to a parent role that can see all.
                                    </li>

                                        When you need to provide access to an arbitrary group of people, you create a public group to collect them, and then use other sharing tools to give the group the necessary access. Group membership alone doesn't provide data access.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Groups can also be nested inside each other, therefore, allowing a nested group to gain the same access as the group in which it is contained. This allows the creation of smaller, ad-hoc hierarchies that don’t necessarily interact with the role or territory hierarchies. If Group A is a member of Group B, then the members of Group A will have access to data shared to Group B at the same access level as the members of Group B.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Groups also have the ability to protect data shared in the group from being made accessible to people in the role hierarchy above the group members. This (and dealing with the access of record owners and their management hierarchy) allows the creation of groups in which very highly confidential information can be shared—the data will be accessible ONLY to group members, and nobody else in the organization. This is accomplished by using the Grant Access Using Hierarchies setting.

                                Criteria-based sharing rules provide access to records based on the record’s field values (criteria). If the criteria are met (one or many field values), then a share record is created for the rule. Record ownership is not a consideration.

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Sometimes it’s impossible to define a consistent group of users who need access to a particular set of records. In those situations, record owners can use manual sharing to give read and edit permissions to users who would not have access to the record any other way. Although manual sharing isn’t automated like organization-wide sharing settings, role hierarchies, or sharing rules, it gives record owners the flexibility to share particular records with users that need to see them.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Manual sharing is removed when the record owner changes or when the sharing access granted doesn't grant additional access beyond the object's organization-wide sharing default access level. This also applies to manual shares created programmatically.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                All share records (standard and custom objects) with a row cause set to manual share can be edited and deleted by the Share button on the object's page layout, even if the share record was created programmatically.

                                Record owners can build a team for each record that they own. The record owner adds team members and specifies the access level each team member has to the record.

                                Only owners, people higher in the hierarchy, and administrators can add team members and provide more access to the member.

                                A team member with read/write access can add another member who already has access to the record with which the team is associated. The team member can't provide them additional access.

                                Creating a team member in the app creates two records: a team record and an associated share record.

                                If you create team members programmatically, you have to manage both the team record and associated share record. There is only one team per record (Account, Opportunity or Case). If multiple teams are needed, depending on your specific needs consider territory management or programmatic sharing.

                                        If teams are managed externally, say through an external commission or territory management system, then integration can be used to manage the account team. There are cases when territory management in an external system can align to a team solution within Salesforce.
